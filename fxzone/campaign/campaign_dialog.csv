Our other troops need to scout and reveal enemies so that the Artillery can fire.;Press 'K' to check the engagement range of any unit.

We are holding a strategically important position that we will only be able to defend by constantly reinforcing our units. The factory we captured can produce additional Infantry each turn.;Damaged units can retreat to a city (if it's under our control) and be repaired at the start of each turn.;We can not let the attackers retake this position. Keep producing new Infantry to hold off the attack.
