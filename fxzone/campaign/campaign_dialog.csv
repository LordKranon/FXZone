Welcome to ZONE. Your units are awaiting commands! Select units by clicking them and then select a position for them to move to. After you have given all your commands, click 'End Turn'.;The enemy has advanced during their turn! Command your units to fight the enemy Infantry by clicking enemies highlighted in RED after selecting your unit.;Eliminate all enemy forces to achieve Victory.;
Advance north into the fog of war to reveal enemy positions. Units have a limited line of sight and will not see enemies that are too far away.;Eliminate all enemy forces or capture both enemy cities in the north to achieve Victory.;;To deal with the enemy Tank, use your RPG Infantry. The rocket-propelled grenade launchers are more effective at dealing with armored vehicles than your regular Infantry's rifles.;These Marauders must have stolen that old tank from the FPA. Likely they looted one of the FPA's abandoned bases.
Marauders are approaching from the east! Our Artillery Cannons can fire from afar but can not defend themselves when attacked directly. Our other troops need to scout and reveal enemies so that the Artillery can fire.;Press 'K' to check the engagement range of any unit. Our Artillery may require repositioning!;Fend off all enemy attackers to achieve Victory. We cannot lose our cities in the West!;;How unusual for the Marauders to engage this aggressively with such a large armored force. They must be receiving military aid from somewhere...
We are holding a strategically important position that we will only be able to defend by constantly reinforcing our units. The factory we captured can produce additional Infantry each turn.;Damaged units can retreat to a city (if it's under our control) and be repaired at the start of each turn.;We can not let the Marauders retake this position. Keep producing new Infantry to hold off the attack.
If we can get the factory up north running again we can produce additional tanks from it.
The enemy has set up their bases in the north-west. We should advance cautiously and capture the unclaimed city in the west to increase our income. Cities under our control generate 50$ each turn.;An ambush! We can not be caught in an open field! We should defend our position before we proceed with our Advances.
Capture the coastal city in the south-west. Intel says this strait is only defended by a small coast guard regiment. Utilize our superior firepower!
Our BATTLE TANK is a powerful war machine with almost impenetrable armor and a special cannon capable of firing shells farther than regular tanks.;Attack enemy tanks from a distance of 2 tiles to rid them of their ability to counter-attack. Defend the city from the approaching waves of armor!
The mountain range can only be crossed by foot soldiers. Position our Artillery cannons in such a way that we can defend the oncoming infantry assault.;Make it a meat grinder for these Neoglow guardsmen!
Grand General! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Gavril Kirov, Admiral of the Fleet. At the ready to help you outmaneuver the enemy ships.;The key to naval victory lies in the Destroyers. They are bigger and slower than gunboats and they deal massive damage to other naval units. Little gunboats pose almost no threat to these ships - use your gunboats for distraction, scouting and to finish off low hp ships.;It is paramount to keep the Destroyers alive, try to use smaller boats to block attacks on your Destroyers whenever possible.;
It is time to prove our defensive capabilities in combined warfare. The Neoglow Guard has us outnumbered in both the ground battle and the naval battle. Hold on to the coastal city like your life depends on it. Because it does.;I recommend constructing additional Artillery. Ranged cannons will help us out on both fronts as we can also use them to fire upon the enemy ships.
Radars are detecting an Air Raid! Without our Anti-Air guns the enemy planes will make quick work out of our ground army.;Our Infantry in particular is at great risk of getting shredded by airplane guns. If necessary, hide in the woods to evade the bonus damage that these planes can dish out.;The FPA is continuing their attack. Assume a defensive position and retreat to the city if necessary.
Our wingmen are in formation. Detecting a high number of enemy aircraft. We have pushed deep into FPA airspace. Ready to surge forward!;To get the upper hand in a dogfight like this, isolate and target down damaged enemy planes. Target enemy Fighter Jets first and with great priority. Finish off low HP enemies with Recon Planes to not waste any high-damage missiles of our Fighter Jets.
Launch a total offensive on the enemy. We desperately need to capture a factory to be able to reinforce this regiment. Capture additional cities along the way if the opportunity presents itself.;The FPA has a factory of their own. We need to close the distance as quickly as possible to stop enemy unit production before our army is overwhelmed.;Our scout airplane has guns that are highly effective vs ground infantry. Just one plane can hold off an entire infantry assault on its own.;It seems the FPA have positioned a high number of Artillery cannons behind the northern mountain range. We will have to push trough all the way to the east to be able to enter upwards.
It is time to prove our offensive capabilities. The Free-Ponzia-Army is sitting in the west across the river. We have to invade and take out both of their factories. Do not hold back.;Block enemy production before they can amass a defensive force large enough to stop our army. Full throttle to the west!
The last remaining military base of the FPA is to the west of us, just north of the city of Upper Ponzia. We have got them up against a mountain wall. Expect a vicious fight.;We can keep our planes resupplied and repaired with the airfield we captured. Use your air superiority to repel the desperate counter-attack of the FPA and then advance to the west.
Our spy battalion in Ground-Zero-Land has been beaten down to just four remaining vehicles. If we lose our only outpost in enemy territory we will not be able to proceed our campaign. Regroup and set up defenses!;The Quicksilver Army has us surrounded. Make a last stand with what we have left!
In the north lies the biggest military base of the Quicksilver Army. It is also the most well-defended area in all of Ground-Zero-Land. Make a focused, decisive push - it will cost us many lives but that is the price we have to pay to establish a foothold in this forsaken place.
The notorious Dr. Stoll has armed his prisoners of war to make them fight a death match on his private man-made island. 3 BATTLE TANKS of the Quicksilver Army versus 2 of ours...
Admiral Kirov, reporting for duty. The seas of Ground-Zero-Land run red with radioactive waste and the blood of sea life. We have established a significant naval presence here. Eliminate the Quicksilver Fleet right here and the war should come to an end...;Our Destroyers are equipped with devastating anti-air capabilities. They are our most important assets in this battle. Also make sure our BATTLESHIP stays safe. Use it to weaken enemy Destroyers from a distance.;Attack Helicopters can bomb Battleships and Gunboats without getting counter-attacked at all.
Here we are, at the heart of Ground-Zero-Land. Dr. Stolls private army is patrolling every corner of this valley. Do not let the massive pressure of his units keep you from expanding your territory.
